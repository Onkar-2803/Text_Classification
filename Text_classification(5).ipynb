        "The final was set to take place in Argentina but was suspended twice after fans turned violent. The first time, on November 25, riot police were called in after supporters of River began throwing stones and bottles at the bus carrying Boca players. Pepper spray used to control the crowds ended up affecting members of the soccer team. The players later shared photos of their injuries. The match was rescheduled but again had to be suspended after fans descended into violence.\n",
        "\n",
        "In view of the insecurity, the South American Football Confederation (Conmebol), which organizes the competition, decided the only solution was to hold the game in a different country. On Thursday, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said Spain would be “willing to organize the Copa Libertadores final between River and Boca” in a message on Twitter, and an hour later Conmebol president Alejandro Domínguez confirmed the game would take place in Madrid.\n",

        "\n",
        "This is the first time a Copa Libertadores game has been played outside the Americas since the competition began in 1960. Domínguez however was positive about the decision: “[Madrid] has the largest Argentine community overseas, Barajas is the airport with the best connection to Latin America, and it is a city with a great soccer culture.”\n",
        "\n",
        "But the feeling in Argentina has been less optimistic. The national newspaper La Nación wrote that “it represents, in some way, the structural failure of our soccer, which is unable to organize the best final in the history of the [Copa] Libertadores.” Online sports daily Ole agreed: “The final in Madrid is a punch in the soul to all fans of soccer in Argentina. Ten thousands kilometers away, River-Boca is an unhappy attempt to transform the classic into a Champions League event.” According to a survey run by Ole, 76% of respondents think it is bad that the game has been moved to Spain.\n",

        "Security risk\n",
        "In a message on Twitter, Sánchez promised that \"security forces have extensive experience of these situations and are already working on the necessary deployments to ensure the event is secure.\" Despite these assurances, there are concerns there is not enough time to properly secure the event. According to sources familiar with the security operations, between four and six weeks are needed to analyze the security needs of high-risk sporting stadiums and the ensuing preparations can take up to eight months. In the case of the Copa Libertadores final, security officials will have just days to prepare.\n",
